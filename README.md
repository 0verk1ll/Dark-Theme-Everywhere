Dark Theme Everywhere is my attempt to encourage more applications, operating systems, and websites to include a dark theme for people who are sensitive to light or suffer from migraines. I am working on this project for a class project, but once I have submitted the assignment, I will allow others to collaborate on the project. I will open source the code and content once I decide what license(s) to use.
